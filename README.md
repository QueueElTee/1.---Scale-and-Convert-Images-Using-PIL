My solution to the first project of the Automating Real World Tasks With Python course (Course 6 of the IT Automation with Python Specialization)

## What it does

- Iterates through images in a directory

### Uses PIL(Python Imaging Library) To:

- Open an image
- Rotate the image 90Â° clockwise
- Resize the image
- Save the image in a different format
- Store the image in  a new directory
